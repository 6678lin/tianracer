# Tianracer
Tianracer is an updated version of Tianbot Racecar. Now all series of racecars are equipped with NVIDIA development boards. e.g, Jetson Nano, Jetson TX2. Now Tianracer inherits AI aiblity from Jetracer. Our goal is to develop a low cost autonomous racing car with not only basic mapping, localization, navigation ability but also object detection, traffic light detection, lane keeping, etc.
